# Library_Call_Numbers_Training_Simulation

Library call numbers are difficult to understand and sort. This training simulation will help library student interns at universities to practice sorting calling numbers and shelving books. I implemented the use of HTML5, ReactJS, JavaScript, CSS3, jQuery, Responsive Web Design, BootStrap 4, and JSON while working on this project.
